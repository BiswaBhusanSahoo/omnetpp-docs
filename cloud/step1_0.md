To put all of this together into a working solution, in the rest of this
tutorial, we're going to:

- Install some necessary software packages on our machine
- Create the Python function that will perform the jobs
- Build a Docker image which includes the worker code and OMNeT++
- Write a command line application for submitting simulations to the queue
- Deploy the system on AWS
- Run a simple simulation campaign with it

Before you begin, create a new empty folder. Later save all linked source files
from this tutorial in that.
